CPMOD - Chemistry and Particulates MODelling
Version 1.0
11/05/2025

The code solves the population balance equation (PBE) in a spatially homogeneous environment, i.e. a perfectly stirred reactor (PSR).
To set up the problem, modify problem.in for the problem choice, pbe.in for the PBE settings, and psr.in for the PSR settings.
A number of test cases are provided, where the settings are built-in rather than read from input files. This ensures that they can always be used for reference if unaltered. Sample figures are provided in the directory test_cases_figures.

For more explanations on the methods in this code, you may refer to the following book and references therein:
Rigopoulos, S. ‘Population Balance of Particles in Flows: From Aerosols to Crystallisation’, Cambridge University Press, 2024.

This is the first version of the code.
The aggregation-fragmentation part can accommodate an arbitrary expanding grid, but a contracting grid is not yet implemented.
Various updates will be carried out in the future.

Compiling the code:

The code can be compiled by running `make -f makefile` in directory compile which creates the file cpmod. Options are offered for the gfortran compiler, either debug or release (optimised).

Running the code:

Choose the desired problem in the problem.in file. Options:
1. PSR with user inputs
2. Aggregation with the constant kernel
3. Aggregation with the Brownian kernel
4. Aggregation-growth
5. Nucleation-growth
6. Uniform binary fragmentation
7. Discrete PBE - aggregation with the Brownian kernel

Input files are in directories pbe and psr. Output is in the following files in directory pbe:
psd.out - particle size distribution (columns: volume at midpoint of interval, equivalent diameter, number density, proportion of total number in interval, volume density of particles, proportion of total volume in interval)
psd_analytical.out - analytical solution for selected cases
psd_sp.out - self-preserving size distribution for Brownian aggregation

The code is executed with `./cpmod`.

Testing the code:

Sample plots are provided for the test cases. To reproduce these plots, run the corresponding test case by selecting its option in the problem.in file.

Instructions for plotting are shown below:

1. PSR with user inputs: currently set up to produce the same input as the test case of aggregation with the Brownian kernel (option 3).
2. Aggregation with the constant kernel: plot psd_analytical.out column 2 (y axis) vs column 1 (x axis) and psd.out column 3 (y axis) vs column 1 (x axis). This plots a comparison of the numerical and analytical solutions in terms of the number distribution, i.e. n(v) - v. See the sample plot agg_constant.pdf.
3. Aggregation with the Brownian kernel: plot psd_sp.out column 2 (y axis) vs column 1 (x axis). This plots the self-preserving distribution in terms of the similarity variable, i.e. psi - eta. See the sample plot agg_Brownian.pdf.
4. Aggregation-growth: plot psd_analytical.out column 3 (y axis) vs column 1 (x axis) and psd.out column 5 (y axis) vs column 1 (x axis). This plots a comparison of the numerical and analytical solutions in terms of the volume distribution, i.e. v*n(v) - v. See the sample plot agg-growth.pdf.
5. Nucleation-growth: plot psd.out column 3 (y axis) vs column 1 (x axis). See the sample plot nuc-growth.pdf.
6. Uniform binary fragmentation: plot psd_analytical.out column 2 (y axis) vs column 1 (x axis) and psd.out column 3 (y axis) vs column 1 (x axis). This plots a comparison of the numerical and analytical solutions in terms of the number distribution, i.e. n(v) - v. See the sample plot frac_un_bin.pdf.
7. Discrete PBE - aggregation with the Brownian kernel: plot psd_sp_discrete.out column 2 (y axis) vs column 1 (x axis). This plots the self-preserving distribution in terms of the similarity variable, i.e. psi - eta. See the sample plot agg_Brownian_discrete.pdf.
